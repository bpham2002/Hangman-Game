# Hangman-Game
<!-- The Hangman Game is a game that let's user guess a letter to figure out the random generating word. This game gives user 16 chances for choosing a letter. If this word contains a guessing letter it will reveal the correct letter in the correct position of the word. It will alert “You Win!” the game if user guesses all correct letter of the word, and it alert you lose if user completes 16 guesses with incorrect letters. It also shows how many chances user still has and all chosen letters by user. This game will be modified and improved in the next few weeks    -->
